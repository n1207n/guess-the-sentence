# React Slingshot (MODIFIED)!

React Slingshot Modified is a variant from [React Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot), a comprehensive starter kit for rapid application development using React.

What's changed from original [React Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot)?

1. **Only unnecessary Demo example files are removed** - Only files that are related to fuel saving logic, are removed :D
2. **Additional linting config files** - Flow & SASS lint config files are included.
3. **Environment variables using dotenv** - No more storing sensitive info to codebase. Create .dev.env or .prod.env file to store secret information. Modify webpack.config files to load those secret data as environment variables.
4. **Bootstrap 3 & font-awesome support**
5. **React storybook and its addon npm packages**
6. **eslint-import-resolver-webpack** - Webpack alias import supported.
